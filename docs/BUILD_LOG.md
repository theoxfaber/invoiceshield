# Build log (Meta Global AI Developer Hackathon, Oct 26 – Nov 4, 2026)

The rules say: "New work only: What you present at this Hackathon must have been built during the event." Every line of code in this repo was written during the event window (kickoff Mon Oct 26, 2026, 22:30 IST = 12:00 PM EDT). Git history is the record; this log adds context per work session. Times are IST.

Prior work, **not** included and not copied: the author's earlier project `agentic-payment-risk-governor` (Rust payment gateway). It informed the idea of a fail-closed governor; the governor in `governor/` is a fresh, smaller rewrite built for invoices.

Planning documents (threat model, eval plan, demo script) were written before kickoff; they contain no code.

## Sessions

### Mon Oct 26, 22:30–23:15 IST — Day 0
- Read the official rules signed in; chose a from-scratch governor (rules: new work only).
- Glimmer smoke test on NVIDIA's free endpoint (outside the repo): JSON schema not enforced, image input works, ~1 min per image call.
- `governor/`: verdict types with no `Allow` severity, escalate-only `merge`, fail-closed checker parsing, strict proposal schema (bank fields → BLOCK), vendor master + PO table + policy, ledger (paid/pending/rejected), rules: unknown vendor, PO ownership/balance/tolerance, cap/threshold, duplicate key (NFKC, dashes, zero-width), IRN duplicate, same invoice other amount, 7-day vendor window, GSTIN and sender-domain issuer binding, bank-box tamper alert; hash-chained audit. 21 tests incl. proptest monotonic merge, checker fault table, forged all-clear, window edges.
- `structural/gstin.py`: mod-36 check character + PAN binding (3 tests; verified against the public sample 27AAPFU0939F1ZV).
- Next: Axum HTTP server + MCP-style proxy tool (`vendor_id, invoice_no, amount, po_ref` only), vendor master JSON fixture with plausible-format bank details and valid-checksum fictional GSTINs, reportlab invoice generator (B01, L01, S01, Nagpur-style bank change), Glimmer provider + caching, OFF agent for the Day 1 risk test.
